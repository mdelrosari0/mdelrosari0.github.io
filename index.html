    <p>This is my cat, and his name is Cow. He is eight months old, and he is very <strong>cute</strong> and <strong>cuddly</strong>. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/8RKD7ve.jpeg" title="Cow baby">This is a picture</a> from when he was younger.
	He is very smart and obsessed with food, which is a bad combination, because he can open drawers to access the food.</p>
